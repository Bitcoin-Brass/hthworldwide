It is a part of human nature to look out for one another, but in some cases, help is not readily available and sometimes there is not enough help.</p> <p>Help The Homeless Worldwide wants to change that by helping those who are in need which will also include other organizations that are under funded across the globe. Help The Homeless Worldwide fully believes in their journey and knows with the help of mankind, they can achieve their goal of helping the homeless worldwide.</p> <p>Without the help from others, the homeless population will continue to grow leaving many people with nothing, including children regardless of their story. This is not how life is supposed to be, we are here together, as one and we should help one another the same as we help ourselves.
